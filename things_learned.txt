Tanya:

1. On the first day we learned about installation process of RVM.
2. Then we learned about the installation of Ruby using RVM.
3. We learned that ruby components can be only read using login shells, and hence we learned about more types of shell.
4. Login shells first read and execute commands from /etc/profile whereas a non login shell reads and executes commands from etc/bash/bash.rc. Non log in shells will source your .bashrc but not you profile.
5. All ruby Libraries are relesed in form of gems.
RUby gems have following componets:- Lib, bin, gemspec, Rakefile, test/spec, Readme.
A collection of gems is called gemsets.
Gemsets can be created using rvm gemset create <name> command.
