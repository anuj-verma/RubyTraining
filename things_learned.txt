1. This is the first thing i have learned
2. This is the second thing i have learned


Tanya:
1. On the first day we learned about installation process of RVM.
2. Then we learned about the installation of Ruby using RVM.
3. We learned that ruby components can be only read using login shells, and hence we learned about more types of shell.
4. Login shells first read and execute commands from /etc/profile whereas a non login shell reads and executes commands from etc/bash/bash.rc. Non log in shells will source your .bashrc but not you profile.

5. All ruby Libraries are relesed in form of gems.
RUby gems have following componets:- Lib, bin, gemspec, Rakefile, test/spec, Readme.
A collection of gems is called gemsets.
Gemsets can be created using rvm gemset create <name> command.

Priyanka:
1. what is RVM : RVM is a command-line tool which allows you to easily install, manage, and work with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems. 
2 How to install RVM :
gpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3 7D2BAF1CF37B13E2069D6956105BD0E739499BDB
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
3.to install a ruby version type : rvm install rubyversionname in terminal
4.gem is a library for ruby,inside gems following components are present 1.code 2.Documentation 3.gemspec

5.gemset : set of gems
command to create gemset:rvm gemset create nameofgemset
command to use gemset :rvm gemset use nameofgemset
command to delete gemset:rvm grmset delete nameofgemset

Harish:
1. I have learned RVM     
2. RVM installation
3. Ruby installation 
4. gem structure
5. learned about gemsets used in ruby 
6. About IRB
7. installed faker gem


Ajay :
The component of gem 
1) lib : content the code for gem
2)test or spec :content the tests.
3)rake file : Content the intruction set
4)Gemspec : Specifies the information like name,version,author,dependencies.


Akshay: 
1. Login shell: A login shell is the first process that executes under out user ID when we log into the session. A login shell is full functional shell.

2. Non login shell: A non login shells is sarted by a program without a login. In this case the program just passes the name og the shell executable.

3. To create gemset we use : rvm gemset create <gemset name>

4. In ruby we can use single line comments using "#" and multiline comments "=begin ... =end"

5. Git is version control system(VCS).
	some useful commands are :
		git init
		git add <filename>
		git status
		git commit -m "message"
		git pull
		git push origin <branch name>



Pinky:
1.I learned how to install rvm command line tool in the bash shell.
2.Then we learned about the GPG keys used while installation.
3.We also learned about the login and non login shell.
Added by anuj
4.We learned about the ruby gems and their structure in detail.
5.We learned about the version control system and out of them we learned about the git version control system.

 
Jyoti:
2.I learned gem and gemset
3.I Version control tool today



Suraj:
    
 1. I learned concept of gemsets used in Ruby. Gemsets are basically the set of related gems kept together. These gems are nothing but the supportive codes that help a bigger project to run. Thus, we can manually create our own gemsets, use them, delete them. I learned some command used with gemsets.. These are as follows.

   *** To create a new gemset:
                            
                              rvm gemset create gemset_name

  *** To delete a gemset:
                             rvm gemset delete gemset_name

        There are 2 built-in gemsets:
                     1) default
                     2) global

   *** To list existing gemsets:
 
                              rvm gemset list

   *** To use specific gemset:
            
                             rvm gemset use gemset_name
        Gemsets are available in "/.rvm/gems/"   path.
          Thus I learned few basic things about gemsets.
 // This is trial one...
